# CCDM bioinformatics slurm scripts

This repository contains a number of SLURM batch scripts, templates, and helper tools that help us work effectively on Pawsey supercomputers.
The scripts should also work on other SLURM based supercomputing clusters, but we can't guarantee it.


## Templates

For info on the pipeline and job templates see [templates](./templates).
These job templates provide examples of how to properly allocate resources for different types of jobs.
In the future we may have some semi-automated dependency based pipelines in here.


## Helper scripts

For details of the scripts available see the [docs](./docs).
The helper scripts are still relatively new so may have some bugs to iron out.
But I think they should prove useful as they are based on a pattern that I've used often.
