# CCDM bioinformatics slurm scripts

This repository contains a number of SLURM batch scripts, templates, and helper tools that help us work effectively on Pawsey supercomputers.
The scripts should also work on other SLURM based supercomputing clusters, but we can't guarantee it.

For info on the pipeline and job templates see [templates](./templates).
For details of the scripts available see the [docs](./docs).
